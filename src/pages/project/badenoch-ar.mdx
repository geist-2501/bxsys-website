The Badenoch AR app is the first of its kind in Scotland - An AR app that allows users to visit reconstructed historical sites in the comfort of their own homes.

It can be downloaded on;
 - [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1550632717?pt=118825784ct=website_store_link&mt=8)
 - [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.whereverly.badenoch.android&referrer=utm_source%3Dwebsite%26utm_medium%3Dwebsite%26utm_campaign%3Dstore_link)

I was the sole engineer on the AR side of the app, which was embedded into a tourism information guidebook app.
